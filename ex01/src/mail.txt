Hi Panos, hi Dror,

attached is our (partial) solution of exercise1.

We implemented two functions intersection1a, intersection2a which
simply call the CGAL library functions do_intersect and intersection.

The next two functions intersection1b, intersection2b are implemented a
little more low-level fashion on top of the orientation tests that
Line_2 objects offer for Point_2 input.

The main function contains some testing involving 5 different segments.
The output consists of two sections:
  1) the tests executed using intersection1a/intersection2a
  2) the tests executed using intersection1b/intersection2b (low-level)

The output indicates that the implementation of our low-level methods
is correct at least for those cases tested here. The test cases cover
  1) segments intersecting in points
  2) segments intersecting in segments
  3) non-intersecting segments
  4) segments intersecting at a node of one of the segments and
  5) input of the same segment twice

The methods could be implemented even on lower levels of abstraction by
implementing the orientation function for three input points by means
of the cross product, i.e. calculating the sign of the determinant of
the orientation matrix.

Best,
Sebastian
